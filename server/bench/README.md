## Benchmarks for Proof Generation

This scirpt performs benchmarks on full cycles of 
proof generation using test data (the prover part of Fig 5).
Assuming all data needed is prefetched, different steps
demonstrated below are timed.

This benchmark also requires all circuits files compiled.

-- timer starts ---
1. generate RSA key
2. build input for proof
3. build proof
4. encode proof 
5. creat CSR
--- timer ends ---
